        "ExAdvisor is a tiny, privacy-first chatbot that helps you decide if and how to reach out to someone from your past. You enter a short profile for each person (TQI, time-to-reply/initiate, where you met, time spent, strengths/weaknesses, contact status). Sensitive notes never leave your machine: when the optional LLM is invoked we send only a redacted summary (contact streaks, toxicity score, rule outcome) so personal identifiers and free-form notes remain local.",

We need to provide list of URLs and boom we have summaries from their latest column of their news. It's just built with some built-in 5 websites as of now, But it could be enhanced to be more dynamic and versatile.",
