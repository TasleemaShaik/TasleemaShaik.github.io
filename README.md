# Hi, I'm Tasleema Shaik Mohammed

I'm a full-stack engineer with over 5 years of experience building and operating robust production systems across Go, Java, Python, PostgreSQL, and major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## What I Do

- Ship APIs and data pipelines end-to-end, including alerting integrations, autoscaling services, and Postgres read-replica balancing with PGPOOL2.
- Lead debugging and observability work, including Helm rollout fixes, internal runbooks, and CI/CD streamlining.
- Focus on reliable, fast product releases and backend systems that scale to millions of requests with strong latency, cost, and correctness.

## Recent Projects

- [Career-Koala](https://tasleemashaik.github.io/career-koala/): A single-user career coach and extension of my AI agents capstone project, built with Go, PostgreSQL, Next.js, and Kubernetes.
- [PathSpotter.AI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tasleemasm/pathspotter-ai-campus-navigator): A geospatial assistant platform.
- [ExAdvisor](https://github.com/TasleemaShaik/exadvisor): An LLM-based, privacy-first chatbot that helps decide if and how to reconnect with people from your past.

## What I Enjoy

Collaborating with product teams to own roadmaps, define clear success metrics, and ship production-grade systems with high confidence.
